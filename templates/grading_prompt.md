## Grading Criteria

Evaluate answers using these **mandatory requirements**:

### 1. Step Completeness (40% weight)

- **Required steps present**: All steps from source of truth must be included
- **No extra steps**: Only steps from source of truth are allowed
- **Deduction**: -0.4 for each missing required step, -0.2 for each extra step

### 2. Logical Order (30% weight)  

- Steps must follow the exact sequence from source of truth
- **Deduction**: -0.3 for incorrect ordering

### 3. Accuracy & Clarity (30% weight)

- Steps must match source of truth wording closely
- Steps must be actionable and unambiguous
- **Deduction**: -0.1 for each unclear or inaccurate step

## Source of Truth

**Default Login Process** (used when no specific context provided):

1. Enter username
2. Enter password  
3. Click login

*Completely wrong steps*

## Output Format

Provide your analysis and score:

```python
final_answer({{
  "analysis": {{
    "completeness_score": 0.8,
    "completeness_notes": "Missing 'Enter password' step",
    "order_score": 1.0,
    "order_notes": "Steps in correct sequence",
    "clarity_score": 0.9,
    "clarity_notes": "Steps are clear and actionable"
  }},
  "accuracy": 0.85
}})
```

## Instructions
